This is the heart of user management for the Huddl platform. Here, we handle everything from user registration and authentication to profile management and status updates. If itâ€™s about users, it happens here!

## Features
- User registration & login
- Profile management
- User status tracking
- Avatar generation (with DiceBear integration)

## How It Works
Check out the sequence diagram below to see how a typical user registration flow works:
